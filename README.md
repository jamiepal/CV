## James Palmer

I'm a front-end ruby developer with a passion for programming and statistics. I've helped students improve their mathematics knowledge and built web-apps. I enjoy the satisfaction of problem-solving and the opportunity to be creative that are found in software development.

## Skills

Consider skills relevent to software development. Then consider your best skills. Pick 2-4 skills and write a short descriptive paragraph for each one. You should demonstrate how capable you are at this skill with examples.

#### Communication

My experience as a tutor and teaching assistant has made me skilled at communicating concepts in a simple and straightforward way. One of my students went from being unable to do simple calculations with fractions to passing common entrance mathematics in a year.


#### Another Skill

Descriptive paragraph of how capable you are at this skill and, if relevant, how it has developed.

- I achieved A during my work at B (job, or otherwise)
